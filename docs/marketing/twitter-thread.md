### Tweet 1 (Hook):
```
🧠 I built a universal memory system for AI tools

Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Aider, VS Code - they all forget everything between sessions

One local database. Shared across 16+ tools. 100% private. Free forever.

🧵 How it works:
```

---

### Tweet 2 (The Problem):
```
Every AI tool starts fresh:
• No memory of previous sessions
• No shared context between tools
• You re-explain your project every damn time

Cloud solutions (Mem0, Zep) force you to pay $50+/month and send your code to their servers

There's a better way ↓

### Tweet 3 (The Solution):
```
SuperLocalMemory: One SQLite database on YOUR machine

Works immediately with:
✅ Claude Desktop (MCP)
✅ Cursor (MCP)
✅ Windsurf (MCP)
✅ VS Code/Copilot (skills)
✅ Aider, Continue.dev, Zed, Cody
✅ 16+ tools total

Zero config. Zero API keys.
```

### Tweet 4 (Architecture):
```
10-layer architecture (each layer additive):

1. SQLite + FTS5 + TF-IDF vectors
2. Hierarchical index (breadcrumbs)
3. Knowledge graph (Leiden clustering)
4. Pattern learning (Bayesian confidence)
5. Universal skills (slash commands)
6. MCP protocol integration
7. Hybrid search
8. Live dashboard
9. Agent tracking
10. A2A protocol (v2.6)

Built on research from Microsoft GraphRAG, Google A2A, MACLA
```

### Tweet 5 (Why Local-First):
```
Why NOT cloud-based memory?

Cloud (Mem0/Zep):
❌ $50+/month forever
❌ Your code on their servers
❌ Vendor lock-in
❌ Breaks when internet is down

Local (SuperLocalMemory):
✅ $0 forever
✅ 100% private
✅ You own your data
✅ Works offline
```

---

### Tweet 6 (Installation):
```
Installation is literally one command:

npm install -g superlocalmemory

That's it. No API keys, no cloud signup, no config files.

Works immediately with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and 13+ other tools via MCP protocol.

Live in 30 seconds.
```

### Tweet 7 (Live Demo):
```
Live dashboard shows:
• Real-time memory operations
• Knowledge graph visualization
• Agent connections (which AI tool wrote what)
• Memory timeline
• Trust scoring (multi-agent validation)

### Tweet 2:
```
Why local-first vs cloud (Mem0/Zep)?

Cloud: $50+/mo, vendor lock-in, your code on their servers
Local: $0 forever, you own your data, works offline

10-layer architecture: SQLite + knowledge graph + MCP protocol + A2A coordination

Install in one command:

npm install -g superlocalmemory

Works immediately with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Aider, VS Code, Continue.dev, Zed, and 9+ other MCP-compatible tools.
