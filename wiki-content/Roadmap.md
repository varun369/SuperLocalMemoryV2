## Planned Releases

### v2.2.0 (Q2 2026) - Performance & Automation

**Theme:** Incremental updates and automation

**Planned Features:**

#### 1. Incremental Graph Updates
**Status:** 🔨 In Development

**Current:** Full graph rebuild required
**Planned:** Incremental updates in the background

**Benefits:**
- Much faster graph updates after each memory
- Real-time graph maintenance
- No need for manual `build-graph` after each memory

#### 2. Auto-Compression
**Status:** 📝 Planned

**Current:** Manual compression trigger
**Planned:** Automatic age-based compression

**How it works:**
- Recent memories: Full content
- Older memories: Summarized automatically
- Oldest memories: Archived with high compression

Access patterns influence which tier memories stay in — frequently accessed memories stay fresh.

#### 3. REST API Server
**Status:** 📝 Planned

**Purpose:** HTTP API for language-agnostic access

**Still 100% local** (binds to localhost only)

#### 4. Docker Container
**Status:** 📝 Planned

**Benefits:**
- One-command deployment
- Isolated environment
- Easy team sharing

#### 5. Performance Dashboard
**Status:** 📝 Planned

Track search latency, save latency, graph build time, and database growth from the CLI.

---

### v2.3.0 (Q3 2026) - Advanced Features

**Theme:** AI integrations and visualization

**Planned Features:**

#### 1. Optional Neural Embeddings
**Status:** 📝 Planned

**Current:** Local vector search (fast, free, good)
**Planned:** Optional enhanced embeddings (slower, paid, higher quality)

**Note:** Existing local search remains the default (free). Enhanced embeddings are opt-in.

#### 2. Local Web UI
**Status:** 📝 Planned (already available as dashboard)

The existing dashboard already provides memory browsing, graph visualization, pattern dashboard, and profile management — all running locally.

#### 3. Multi-Language Support
**Status:** 📝 Planned

**Current:** Optimized for English
**Planned:** Support for 20+ languages

#### 4. Additional Pattern Categories
**Status:** 📝 Planned

Expand pattern detection to include testing strategies, error handling patterns, logging preferences, documentation style, deployment strategies, and more.

#### 5. Typed Memory Relationships
**Status:** 📝 Planned

**Current:** Generic similarity edges
**Planned:** Typed relationships (similar to, references, contradicts, supersedes, implements, caused by)

---

### v2.8 (Q3-Q4 2026) - Multi-Agent Collaboration

**Theme:** Agent-to-Agent protocol support

**Why?** MCP (Model Context Protocol) connects AI tools to memory (agent-to-tool). The Agent-to-Agent Protocol enables AI agents to collaborate with each other through shared memory. Together, MCP + A2A make SuperLocalMemory the complete memory backbone for the multi-agent era.

**Planned Features:**

#### 1. A2A Agent Discovery
SuperLocalMemory becomes discoverable by other A2A-compatible agents, which can delegate memory tasks to it.

#### 2. Agent Authentication & Security
Control which agents can access your memory. Local-first security model with per-agent permissions.

#### 3. Memory Task Management
Stateful, async memory operations that other agents can track.

#### 4. Real-Time Memory Broadcasting
When Agent A stores a memory, Agent B gets notified instantly — enabling seamless multi-tool workflows.

**Core principle:** A2A is opt-in. The system works perfectly with MCP-only. A2A adds multi-agent collaboration for users who need it.

---

### v3.0.0 (Q4 2026) - Distribution & Ecosystem

**Theme:** Professional packaging and ecosystem expansion

**Planned Features:**

#### 1. Native Windows Installer
**Status:** 📝 Planned

**Current:** Works on Windows but requires manual setup
**Planned:** Native Windows installer (MSI, PowerShell integration)

#### 2. IDE Extensions
**Status:** 📝 Planned

- **VS Code Extension:** Memory search panel, quick commands
- **JetBrains Plugin:** IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm

---

## Long-Term Vision (2027+)

### Collaborative Features

#### Team Memory Sync
Optional encrypted cloud sync for teams — end-to-end encrypted, user controls the keys, default remains local-only.

#### Shared Profiles
Git-like profile sharing for teams.

### AI Enhancements

#### Memory Suggestions
AI suggests what to remember based on your current context.

#### Smart Summarization
AI-generated compression for older memories.

#### Context-Aware Recall
Automatic recall of relevant memories based on what you're currently working on.
