## 🎯 What is SuperLocalMemory?

SuperLocalMemory V2 is an **intelligent ai memory system** that makes AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and other mcp-server compatible tools remember everything about you and your projects. Created by **Varun Pratap Bhardwaj**, this local-first memory solution is the perfect alternative to Mem0 and Zep. Unlike cloud-based alternatives like Mem0 ($50+/mo) or Zep ($50/mo), SuperLocalMemory is:

- **100% Local** — Your data never leaves your machine
- **100% Free** — No usage limits, no credit systems, forever
- **100% Private** — GDPR/HIPAA compliant by default
- **Works Everywhere** — 11+ IDEs including Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, Windsurf, VS Code, and more

## 🏆 Why SuperLocalMemory?

### The Problem

Every Claude session:
```
You: "Remember that auth bug we fixed?"
Claude: "I don't have access to previous conversations..."
You: *sighs and re-explains everything*
```

### The Solution

```bash
# Save once
superlocalmemoryv2:remember "Fixed auth bug - JWT tokens expiring too fast"

# Recall forever
superlocalmemoryv2:recall "auth bug"
# ✓ Found: "Fixed auth bug - JWT tokens expiring too fast"
```
