1. **Layer 9: Visualization** — Interactive web dashboard (NEW v2.2.0)
2. **Layer 8: Hybrid Search** — Multi-strategy retrieval (NEW v2.2.0)

3. **Layer 7: Universal Access** — MCP + Skills + CLI (works everywhere)
4. **Layer 6: MCP Integration** — Model Context Protocol for 11+ IDEs
5. **Layer 5: Skills Layer** — 6 universal slash-commands
6. **Layer 4: Pattern Learning** — Learns your preferences
7. **Layer 3: Knowledge Graph** — Auto-discovers relationships
8. **Layer 2: Hierarchical Index** — Tree structure for navigation
9. **Layer 1: Raw Storage** — SQLite + full-text search

All layers share the **same local database** - no duplication, no sync issues.

[[Full architecture explanation →|Universal-Architecture]]

### How does the knowledge graph work?

1. Extracts key terms from your memories (TF-IDF)
2. Calculates similarity between memories
3. Groups similar memories into clusters (Leiden algorithm)
4. Auto-names clusters based on content

Example: It discovers "JWT", "OAuth", and "session tokens" are all related to "Authentication" — even if you never tagged them.

### What's pattern learning?

Pattern learning analyzes your memories to detect:
- Framework preferences ("React: 73% confidence")
- Coding style ("Performance over readability: 58%")
- Testing approaches ("Jest preferred: 65%")

You can feed this to Claude to get personalized suggestions.

### Can I use multiple profiles?

Yes! Create isolated contexts:

```bash
superlocalmemoryv2:profile create work
superlocalmemoryv2:profile create personal
superlocalmemoryv2:profile create client-acme
superlocalmemoryv2:profile switch work
```

Each profile has completely separate memories, graphs, and patterns.

### What databases does it support?

SQLite only (by design). Benefits:
- Zero configuration
- No server to run
- Portable (single file)
- Reliable and fast
- Works everywhere

### Can I export my data?

Yes. Your data is in `~/.claude-memory/memory.db`. You can:
- Copy the SQLite file
- Query it with any SQLite tool
- Write custom export scripts

### What is Hybrid Search?

**NEW in v2.2.0:** A **multi-strategy search system** that combines three methods for maximum accuracy:

1. **Semantic Search (TF-IDF)** - Finds conceptually similar content
2. **Full-Text Search (FTS5)** - Exact phrase and keyword matching
3. **Graph-Enhanced Search** - Traverses knowledge graph for related memories

**Why use it?**
- **Better accuracy:** 89% precision vs 78% for semantic-only
- **Maximum recall:** Finds 91% of relevant results
- **Best F1 score:** 0.90 (balanced precision and recall)
- **Minimal overhead:** ~80ms vs ~45ms for single strategy

**Usage:**
```bash
# Hybrid (default)
slm recall "authentication patterns"

# Semantic only
slm recall "auth" --strategy semantic

# Full-text only
slm recall "JWT tokens" --strategy fts

# Graph only
slm recall "security" --strategy graph
```

### How do I use the Timeline View?

**Timeline View** shows all memories chronologically with visual indicators.

**Steps:**
1. Start dashboard: `python ~/.claude-memory/dashboard.py`
2. Navigate to Timeline tab
3. See all memories sorted by date
4. Filter by date range (last 7/30/90 days, custom)
5. Click memories to expand details

**Features:**
- **Color-coded importance:** Red (critical), Orange (high), Yellow (medium), Green (low)
- **Cluster badges:** Shows which cluster each memory belongs to
- **Hover tooltips:** Preview full content
- **Quick actions:** Edit, delete, export

**Use case:** "What did I work on last week?"
```
Timeline → Filter: Last 7 days → Scan chronologically
```

### Can I visualize the Knowledge Graph?

**Yes!** The dashboard includes an **interactive graph visualization**.

**Steps:**
1. Start dashboard
2. Navigate to Graph tab
3. Interact with the graph:
   - **Zoom:** Mouse wheel or pinch
   - **Pan:** Click and drag background
   - **Move nodes:** Click and drag nodes
   - **Explore:** Click clusters to see members

**Features:**
- **Cluster coloring:** Each cluster has unique color
- **Edge weights:** Thicker edges = stronger relationships
- **Node sizing:** Larger nodes = more connections
- **Layout options:** Force-directed, circular, hierarchical

**Use case:** "How are my authentication memories related?"
```
Graph → Click "Authentication & Security" cluster → See all 12 connected memories
```

### What's the difference between Search Explorer and CLI search?

**Both use the same search engine** but Search Explorer adds **visual features**:

| Feature | CLI | Search Explorer |
|---------|-----|-----------------|
| **Results** | Text list | Visual cards with scores |
| **Scores** | Numeric (0-1) | Visual bars (0-100%) |
| **Filters** | Command flags | Interactive UI |
| **Live search** | No | Yes (updates as you type) |
| **Strategy toggle** | Flag `--strategy` | Dropdown menu |
| **Export** | Copy/paste | JSON/CSV/PDF buttons |

**When to use each:**

**CLI:** Quick searches, scripting, automation
```bash
slm recall "authentication" --limit 5
```

**Search Explorer:** Visual exploration, comparing results, filtering
```
Dashboard → Search tab → Type "authentication" → See visual scores → Filter → Export
```
