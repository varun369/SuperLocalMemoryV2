"""Synthetic fixture generator for the evo-memory benchmark.

NOT executed in CI. Run once, check the output JSONL + SHA-256 sidecar
into the repo, and then the harness verifies the hash on every run
(LLD-14 §2.2).

Invocation:

    python tests/test_benchmarks/fixtures/generate_synthetic_fixture.py

Produces next to this script:

- ``evo_memory_synthetic_v1.jsonl`` — ~500 seeds + 30 days of activity
  and test queries, interleaved in chronological order.
- ``evo_memory_synthetic_v1.sha256`` — one-line hex digest, verified at
  harness start-up.

The fixture is the contract. Any non-backward-compat change bumps the
version and adds a new ``_v2.jsonl`` beside this one — never mutate v1.
