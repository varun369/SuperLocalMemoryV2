# Changelog

All notable changes to SuperLocalMemory V3 will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

### [Unreleased]
- **License:** Changed from Elastic-2.0 to AGPL-3.0-or-later to protect research IP

---

## [3.4.33] - 2026-04-25

Fix: daemon leaked SQLite connections to learning.db via bandit threadlocals.

### Fixed
- **Bandit threadlocal connection leak.** `reward_proxy.settle_stale_plays`
  creates a `ContextualBandit` that opens a threadlocal connection via
  `_conn_for`. When called from `asyncio.to_thread` (bandit_loops.py,
  every 60 s), each thread-pool thread kept its connection open for the
  process lifetime. Over 24 h this accumulated 12+ leaked file descriptors
  and ~100 MB of wasted SQLite page-cache RAM. New
  `bandit.close_threadlocal_conn()` function, called in the
  `settle_stale_plays` finally block, ensures pool threads release their
  connections immediately.
- **Corrected embedding worker memory comment.** The `~200MB footprint`
  note was written for `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`; the default model
  `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5` uses ~1.1 GB via ONNX.

---

## [3.4.32] - 2026-04-24

Fix: concurrent remembers no longer block recalls on the shared embedder.

### Fixed
- **Daemon `/remember` is now async by default.** Writes to the pending
  queue in under 100 ms and returns a `pending_id`; a background thread
  drains the queue in the background. Previously, the synchronous
  `engine.store()` on the FastAPI event loop could block `/search` and
  `/health` for 30+ seconds while the single embedder worker processed a
  large write. Under concurrent load the daemon could appear hung.
- **Materializer yields to active recalls.** While any `/search` is in
  flight the drainer sleeps between items, so user-initiated recalls
  always get the embedder first.
- **MCP remember tool simplified.** Writes to `pending.db` and returns;
  the daemon's materializer completes the pipeline. Removes the
  redundant in-process `pool.store` background task that previously
  contended with `/search`.
- **`pool_store` returns `["pending:<id>"]`** when the daemon is async,
  keeping a stable identifier for callers without blocking on the
  embedder.

### Added
- `?wait=true` query parameter on `POST /remember` for callers that
  need synchronous behaviour and real `fact_ids` in the response.
- `superlocalmemory.core.recall_gate` module — shared counter that lets
  the materializer detect in-flight recalls and yield priority.

### Migration notes
- **No action required.** Existing clients continue to work; the
  response shape is compatible (`ok`, `count` still present). Scripts
  that depended on `fact_ids` to validate the write should switch to
  `pending_id` or pass `?wait=true` to opt in to the legacy behaviour.

---

## [3.4.31] - 2026-04-24

Dashboard truth, memory vs fact clarity, and self-cleaning pending queue.

### Changed
- **Dashboard now shows both memory counts honestly.** Parent memories
  (what you stored) and atomic facts (what retrieval indexes) appear as
  two distinct cards with their ratio. No more "Total Memories: 6,000"
  when you actually have 2,000 memories decomposed into 6,000 facts.
- **"Browse atomic facts"** relabeled for clarity — this view lists the
  indexed atomic units.
- **Visible search box** in the Memories tab — previously hidden behind
  the Recall Lab only. Search now debounces 280 ms on input.

### Added
- **`/api/memories/{id}/detail`** — full memory + all child atomic facts
  in one call. Powers the click-to-expand modal.
- **`/api/facts/{id}`** — single atomic fact detail with source memory
  content, entities, and canonical entities.
- **Pagination UI** — Prev/Next controls show "Showing 1–50 of 6,123".
  Previously hardcoded to 50 with no navigation.
- **CSV export** — new `format=csv` option on `/api/export` plus a
  dedicated "Export All (CSV)" menu item. JSON and JSONL still work.
- **Export progress toast** — "Preparing JSON export…" notification
  before the download starts.
- **`total_facts` + `facts_per_memory`** in `/api/stats` response.
- **Pending queue auto-cleanup** — the maintenance scheduler now sweeps
  the pending queue every cycle: completed rows > 7 days, failed rows
  over retry limit, and stuck rows > 7 days are removed; a 30-day hard
  cap prevents runaway growth on any status.

### Fixed
- **Test isolation** — `pending_store` now honors `SLM_DATA_DIR`. Four
  MCP remember tests were writing to the live `~/.superlocalmemory/`
  instead of `tmp_path`. Root conftest now forces `SLM_DATA_DIR=tmp_path`
  for every test unless explicitly opted out.
- **Fact click popup** — was calling `/api/v3/recall/trace` with a text
  substring (re-query by first 100 chars) and colliding with the memory
  row click handler. Now scoped to `.fact-result-item` only, hits the
  new `/api/facts/{fact_id}` endpoint.
- **Memory modal ID confusion** — the modal labeled `mem.id` as "ID"
  regardless of whether it was a memory_id or fact_id. Now displays
  both "Memory ID" and "Fact ID" when they differ.
- **Memory modal hydration** — fetches the full memory + fact list
  asynchronously when opened, so source content and entity data appear
  even for rows that arrived from the search endpoint.

---

## [3.4.30] - 2026-04-24

Multi-IDE shared worker, silent migration, and security hardening.

### Added
- **Multi-IDE RAM sharing.** MCP processes share a single recall worker
  via the daemon. Total RSS stays below 2 GB with four IDEs open.
- **Feedback and learning signals** flow from every IDE session to the
  daemon, not just the first.
- **Setup wizard** validates the data directory at install time and
  rejects iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box, Google Drive, and
  `Library/CloudStorage` paths that silently corrupt SQLite WAL.
- **One-time upgrade banner** after `pip install -U` / `npm install -g`
  points users to `slm doctor`.
- **`docs/errors.md`** — canonical error catalog with codes, recovery
  steps, exit codes, and HTTP status mappings.
- **CI matrix** now runs on `ubuntu-22.04`, `macos-14` (Apple Silicon),
  and `windows-latest` with `portalocker`.

### Changed
- **Silent, atomic data migration** on upgrade — no manual steps.
- **Migration serialized via file lock** so parallel pip + npm installs
  cannot race.
- **Concurrent-safe MCP engine singleton** with double-checked locking.
- Pool adapter returns frozen dataclasses instead of `SimpleNamespace`.

### Security
- File permissions tightened: marker files written at 0600, parent
  directories at 0700.
- Symlink-following blocked on version marker reads.
- Cloud-synced directory detection extended to `Library/CloudStorage`
  (macOS 13+).

### Fixed
- Silent error swallows in daemon shutdown, migration probe, and banner
  emission now log at WARNING.
- Fenced-out `complete()` writes (stale worker claims) emit a WARNING
  log instead of vanishing silently.
- Daemon-start migration guarded behind `is_ready` sentinel — skips
  when already applied.

---

## [3.4.23] - 2026-04-21

Critical hotfix on top of 3.4.22 for two end-user-facing regressions.

### Fixed
- **Daemon error log no longer balloons.** A ternary passed as the
  `logger.info` format string caused a `TypeError` on every startup in 24/7
  mode. Python's logging module then dumped the full FastAPI
  `merged_lifespan` stack to stderr; over a day the LaunchAgent log grew to
  tens of MB. The call is now pre-formatted. A defensive log-rotation pass
  at startup truncates any daemon log over 10 MB so users upgrading from
  3.4.22 get a clean slate on first boot.
- **Dashboard no longer hangs after a daemon upgrade.** Static JS/CSS/HTML
  was served without cache headers, so browsers served stale modules after
  `slm restart` and the dashboard showed an infinite spinner. All static
  responses now ship `Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate`, and
  `index.html` embeds the server version; on mismatch the tab clears
  `localStorage` (preserving theme) and hard-reloads once.
- **Fetches can no longer hang forever.** A global `fetch` patch attaches a
  15-second `AbortController` timeout to every relative-URL request, so a
  dead socket surfaces as a rejection instead of leaving a spinner
  spinning. No callsite changes required.

### Added
- `GET /api/version` — returns the running daemon version; consumed by the
  dashboard version-fingerprint auto-reload.

---

## [3.4.22] - 2026-04-18

Hardening release — correctness, stability, and security fixes.

### Added
- `slm benchmark` plus escape-hatch commands (`disable`, `enable`,
  `clear-cache`, `reconfigure`).
- One-time upgrade banner on first boot after install.

### Changed
- Tighter defaults for the interactive installer.
- Licence: AGPL-3.0-or-later.
- Node.js prerequisite: ≥ 18.

### Security
- Hardened redaction, path validation, and token handling per internal
  audit. No end-user-visible behaviour change.

### Compatibility
- Fully backward compatible. `atomic_facts` is never modified by any
  migration. All upgrades are additive.

---

## [3.4.19] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- Recall cold-start eliminated. Embedding + reranker workers stay warm for 30 minutes by default instead of 2 minutes, so bursts of recalls no longer pay a 30-60 second model-load tax on every other query.

### New environment variables
- `SLM_EMBED_IDLE_TIMEOUT` — seconds to keep the embedding worker warm (default 1800). Set to 120 to restore pre-v3.4.19 behavior.
- `SLM_RERANKER_IDLE_TIMEOUT` — same, for the cross-encoder reranker (default 1800).

---

## [3.4.18] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- pip and npm installs now ship identical functionality. Semantic search and cross-encoder reranking work out of the box on pip (previously required `pip install superlocalmemory[search]`).
- First pip run auto-installs Claude Code hooks when Claude Code is detected, matching the npm postinstall experience.

---

## [3.4.17] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- Entity Explorer no longer stuck on "No entities found" after switching operating modes.
- Engine-backed routes (entity, ingest, recall, remember, list) auto-recover after mode changes — no daemon restart required.

### Added
- Mode change audit log at `~/.superlocalmemory/logs/mode-audit.log`.
- Mode C now requires an explicit API key via Settings to prevent accidental cloud-mode writes.

## [3.3.28] - 2026-04-07 — Stability Hotfix

### Fixed
- **Excessive memory usage during rapid file edits** — auto-observe now reuses a single background process instead of spawning one per edit. Rapid multi-file operations (parallel agents, branch switching, batch edits) no longer risk high memory usage.
- **Observation debounce** — rapid-fire observations are batched and deduplicated within a short window, reducing redundant work.
- **Memory-aware worker management** — new safety check skips heavy processing when system memory is low.

### New Environment Variables
| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SLM_OBSERVE_DEBOUNCE_SEC` | `3.0` | Observation batching window |
| `SLM_MIN_AVAILABLE_MEMORY_GB` | `2.0` | Min free RAM for background processing |

---

## [3.3.3] - 2026-04-01 — Langevin Awakening

### Fixed
- **Langevin dynamics now active** — positions were never initialized at store time, causing the entire Langevin lifecycle system to be inert (0 positioned facts). New facts now receive near-origin positions (Strategy A).
- **Backfill for existing facts** — maintenance now initializes unpositioned facts using metadata-aware equilibrium seeding (Strategy B) followed by 50-step burn-in (Strategy C). Old, rarely-accessed facts land in their correct lifecycle zones immediately.

### Improved
- Maintenance returns `langevin_backfilled` count for observability
- Health check now reports positioned facts accurately after backfill

---

## [3.3.0] - 2026-03-31 — The Living Brain

### New Features
- **Adaptive Memory Lifecycle** — memories naturally strengthen with use and fade when neglected. No manual cleanup needed.
- **Smart Compression** — embedding precision adapts to memory importance, achieving up to 32x storage savings on low-priority memories.
- **Cognitive Consolidation** — automatic pattern extraction from clusters of related memories. Your knowledge graph self-organizes.
- **Pattern Learning** — auto-learned soft prompts injected into agent context at session start. The system teaches itself what matters.
- **Hopfield Retrieval** — 6th retrieval channel for vague or partial query completion. Ask half a question, get the whole answer.
- **Process Health** — automatic detection and cleanup of orphaned SLM processes. No more zombie workers.

### New CLI Commands
- `slm decay` — run memory lifecycle review
- `slm quantize` — run smart compression cycle
- `slm consolidate --cognitive` — extract patterns from memory clusters
- `slm soft-prompts` — view auto-learned patterns
- `slm reap` — clean orphaned processes

### New MCP Tools
- `forget` — programmatic memory archival via lifecycle rules
- `quantize` — trigger smart compression on demand
- `consolidate_cognitive` — extract and store patterns from memory clusters
- `get_soft_prompts` — retrieve auto-learned patterns for context injection
- `reap_processes` — clean orphaned SLM processes
- `get_retention_stats` — memory lifecycle analytics

### Dashboard
- 7 new API endpoints for lifecycle stats, compression stats, patterns, and process health
- New dashboard tabs: Memory Lifecycle, Compression, Patterns

### Improvements
- Mode A/B memory usage reduced from ~4GB to ~40MB (100x reduction)
- Embedding migration on mode switch (auto-detects model change)
- Forgetting filter in retrieval pipeline (archived memories excluded from results)
- 6-channel retrieval (was 5)

### Migration

- Memory surfacing engine with multi-signal scoring

### Performance
- Significant latency reduction in recall operations (vector-indexed retrieval)
- Idle-time memory optimization for large stores
- Reduced memory footprint for long-running sessions

---

## [3.2.1] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Windows `slm --version` / `slm -v`** — `.bat` and `.cmd` wrappers now intercept `--version`/`-v` directly (fast path, no Python needed) and set `PYTHONPATH` to the npm package's `src/` directory before launching Python. Previously, Windows users hitting `slm.bat` instead of the Node.js wrapper got `unrecognized arguments: --version` because Python resolved an older pip-installed version without the flag.
- **Unix bash wrapper** (`bin/slm`) — now sets `PYTHONPATH` and intercepts `--version`/`-v`, matching the Node.js wrapper's behavior. Previously relied on npm's shim always routing to `slm-npm`.
- **`postinstall.js`** — now runs `pip install .` to install the `superlocalmemory` Python package itself (not just dependencies). Prevents stale pip-installed versions from shadowing the npm-distributed source. Falls back to `--user` for PEP 668 environments.
- **`preuninstall.js`** — corrected version string from "V2" to "V3".
- **Windows Python detection** — added `py -3` (Python Launcher for Windows) as a fallback candidate in `slm.bat`.
- **Environment parity** — all three entry points (`slm-npm`, `slm`, `slm.bat`) now set identical PyTorch memory-prevention env vars (`PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO`, `TORCH_DEVICE`, etc.).

---

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **`slm doctor` command** — comprehensive pre-flight check: Python version, all dependency groups, embedding worker functional test, Ollama connectivity, API key validation, disk space, database integrity. Supports `--json` for agent-native output.
- **`slm hooks install`** listed in CLI reference and README.
- Dashboard, learning (lightgbm), and performance (diskcache, orjson) dependencies now install automatically during `npm install`.

### Fixed
- **Warmup reliability** — increased subprocess timeout from 60s to 180s for first-time model download. Added step-by-step progress output and direct in-process import diagnostics when worker fails.
- **Mode B default model** — changed from `phi3:mini` to `llama3.2` to match `provider_presets()` and reduce first-time setup friction.
- **postinstall.js** — now installs all 5 dependency groups (core, search, dashboard, learning, performance) with clear status messages per group.
- **Error messages** — all embedding worker failures, engine fallbacks, and dashboard errors now suggest `slm doctor` for diagnosis.
- **pyproject.toml** — added `diskcache` and `orjson` to core dependencies; aligned optional dependency versions with core.

---
