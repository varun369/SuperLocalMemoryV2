SuperLocalMemory V3 - Intelligent local memory system for AI coding assistants.

## [3.3.3] - 2026-04-01 — Langevin Awakening

### Fixed
- **Langevin dynamics now active** — positions were never initialized at store time, causing the entire Langevin lifecycle system to be inert (0 positioned facts). New facts now receive near-origin positions (Strategy A).
- **Backfill for existing facts** — maintenance now initializes unpositioned facts using metadata-aware equilibrium seeding (Strategy B) followed by 50-step burn-in (Strategy C). Old, rarely-accessed facts land in their correct lifecycle zones immediately.

### Improved
- Maintenance returns `langevin_backfilled` count for observability
- Health check now reports positioned facts accurately after backfill

---

## [3.3.0] - 2026-03-31 — The Living Brain

### New Features
- **Adaptive Memory Lifecycle** — memories naturally strengthen with use and fade when neglected. No manual cleanup needed.
- **Smart Compression** — embedding precision adapts to memory importance, achieving up to 32x storage savings on low-priority memories.
- **Cognitive Consolidation** — automatic pattern extraction from clusters of related memories. Your knowledge graph self-organizes.
- **Pattern Learning** — auto-learned soft prompts injected into agent context at session start. The system teaches itself what matters.
- **Hopfield Retrieval** — 6th retrieval channel for vague or partial query completion. Ask half a question, get the whole answer.
- **Process Health** — automatic detection and cleanup of orphaned SLM processes. No more zombie workers.

### New CLI Commands
- `slm decay` — run memory lifecycle review
- `slm quantize` — run smart compression cycle
- `slm consolidate --cognitive` — extract patterns from memory clusters
- `slm soft-prompts` — view auto-learned patterns
- `slm reap` — clean orphaned processes

### New MCP Tools
- `forget` — programmatic memory archival via lifecycle rules
- `quantize` — trigger smart compression on demand
- `consolidate_cognitive` — extract and store patterns from memory clusters
- `get_soft_prompts` — retrieve auto-learned patterns for context injection
- `reap_processes` — clean orphaned SLM processes
- `get_retention_stats` — memory lifecycle analytics

### Dashboard
- 7 new API endpoints for lifecycle stats, compression stats, patterns, and process health
- New dashboard tabs: Memory Lifecycle, Compression, Patterns

### Improvements
- Mode A/B memory usage reduced from ~4GB to ~40MB (100x reduction)
- Embedding migration on mode switch (auto-detects model change)
- Forgetting filter in retrieval pipeline (archived memories excluded from results)
- 6-channel retrieval (was 5)

### Migration
- Fully backward compatible with 3.2.x
- New tables created automatically on first run
- No manual migration needed

---

## [3.2.2] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- Performance improvements for retrieval pipeline
- New memory management capabilities with configurable lifecycle controls
- Enhanced dashboard with 3 additional monitoring tabs
- 9 new API endpoints for configuration and status
- 5 new MCP tools for proactive memory operations
- 5 new CLI commands for configuration management

### Changed
- Internal retrieval architecture optimized with additional search channel
- Schema extensions for improved data management (9 new tables)
- Memory surfacing engine with multi-signal scoring

### Performance
- Significant latency reduction in recall operations (vector-indexed retrieval)
- Idle-time memory optimization for large stores
- Reduced memory footprint for long-running sessions

---

## [3.2.1] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Windows `slm --version` / `slm -v`** — `.bat` and `.cmd` wrappers now intercept `--version`/`-v` directly (fast path, no Python needed) and set `PYTHONPATH` to the npm package's `src/` directory before launching Python. Previously, Windows users hitting `slm.bat` instead of the Node.js wrapper got `unrecognized arguments: --version` because Python resolved an older pip-installed version without the flag.
- **Unix bash wrapper** (`bin/slm`) — now sets `PYTHONPATH` and intercepts `--version`/`-v`, matching the Node.js wrapper's behavior. Previously relied on npm's shim always routing to `slm-npm`.
- **`postinstall.js`** — now runs `pip install .` to install the `superlocalmemory` Python package itself (not just dependencies). Prevents stale pip-installed versions from shadowing the npm-distributed source. Falls back to `--user` for PEP 668 environments.
- **`preuninstall.js`** — corrected version string from "V2" to "V3".
- **Windows Python detection** — added `py -3` (Python Launcher for Windows) as a fallback candidate in `slm.bat`.
- **Environment parity** — all three entry points (`slm-npm`, `slm`, `slm.bat`) now set identical PyTorch memory-prevention env vars (`PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO`, `TORCH_DEVICE`, etc.).

---

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **`slm doctor` command** — comprehensive pre-flight check: Python version, all dependency groups, embedding worker functional test, Ollama connectivity, API key validation, disk space, database integrity. Supports `--json` for agent-native output.
- **`slm hooks install`** listed in CLI reference and README.
- Dashboard, learning (lightgbm), and performance (diskcache, orjson) dependencies now install automatically during `npm install`.

### Fixed
- **Warmup reliability** — increased subprocess timeout from 60s to 180s for first-time model download. Added step-by-step progress output and direct in-process import diagnostics when worker fails.
- **Mode B default model** — changed from `phi3:mini` to `llama3.2` to match `provider_presets()` and reduce first-time setup friction.
- **postinstall.js** — now installs all 5 dependency groups (core, search, dashboard, learning, performance) with clear status messages per group.
- **Error messages** — all embedding worker failures, engine fallbacks, and dashboard errors now suggest `slm doctor` for diagnosis.
- **pyproject.toml** — added `diskcache` and `orjson` to core dependencies; aligned optional dependency versions with core.

---
