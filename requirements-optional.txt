# SuperLocalMemory V2.2.0 - Optional Search Components
#
# These dependencies are OPTIONAL and enhance performance:
# - hnswlib: 10-20x faster search with HNSW algorithm
# - sentence-transformers: True semantic search with local embeddings
#
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-optional.txt
#
# If not installed, the system gracefully falls back to:
# - Linear search (sklearn-based, still fast for <10K memories)
# - TF-IDF vectors (keyword-based, no semantic understanding)

# HNSW Index - Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search
# Provides: Sub-10ms search for 10K vectors
# Fallback: sklearn cosine_similarity (linear search)
hnswlib>=0.7.0

# Sentence Transformers - Local Semantic Embeddings
# Provides: True semantic search, GPU acceleration
# Fallback: TF-IDF vectorization (sklearn)
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0

# Note: sentence-transformers automatically installs:
# - torch (PyTorch) - GPU acceleration
# - transformers (Hugging Face) - Model loading
# - tqdm - Progress bars
# Total size: ~500MB (first install only, cached locally)

# GPU Acceleration (optional, auto-detected)
# For NVIDIA GPUs: torch with CUDA support
# For Apple Silicon: torch with MPS support
# Installation is automatic with sentence-transformers
