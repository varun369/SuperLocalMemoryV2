# SuperLocalMemory V2 - Dashboard Screenshots

**Generated:** February 12, 2026
**Profile:** demo-visual (synthetic data)
**Resolution:** 1920x1080 @ 2x DPI
**Format:** PNG, lossless

## Purpose

These screenshots document the SuperLocalMemory V2 web dashboard interface using synthetic, non-sensitive demo data. They are intended for:

- Documentation (GitHub README, Wiki)
- Marketing materials (website, blog posts)
- User guides and tutorials
- Project presentations

## Demo Data

The screenshots use a dedicated `demo-visual` profile containing 30 synthetic memories about software development best practices. Topics include:

- **API Development:** FastAPI, JWT authentication, rate limiting, versioning
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, Alembic migrations, connection pooling
- **Frontend:** React functional components, Zustand state management, Vite bundling
- **DevOps:** Docker Compose, GitHub Actions CI/CD, AWS deployment
- **Security:** Environment variables, CORS, security headers, input validation
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch, Datadog, logging strategies
- **Testing:** pytest, Jest, load testing with Locust
- **Architecture:** Celery background tasks, Redis caching, WebSocket real-time updates

**Knowledge Graph Statistics:**
- 30 memories
- 30 graph nodes
- 34 edges (relationships)
- 6 clusters (semantic groupings)

## Usage Instructions

### For Documentation

**GitHub README:**
```markdown
![SuperLocalMemory Dashboard](assets/screenshots/dashboard/dashboard-overview.png)
```

**Website/Marketing:**
- Use `dashboard-overview.png` for landing page hero section
- Use `dashboard-memories.png` to show memory management features
- Use `dashboard-live-events.png` to demonstrate real-time capabilities

**User Guides:**
- Use `dashboard-filtered.png` to explain search functionality
- Use `dashboard-clusters.png` to explain knowledge graph clustering
- Use `dashboard-patterns.png` to explain pattern learning features

### For Presentations

Recommended sequence for product demos:
1. `dashboard-overview.png` - Start with the big picture (graph + stats)
2. `dashboard-memories.png` - Show the memory list and organization
3. `dashboard-live-events.png` - Demonstrate real-time updates
4. `dashboard-graph.png` - Deep dive into knowledge graph relationships

### Regenerating Screenshots

If you need to regenerate these screenshots with updated UI:

```bash
# 1. Create demo data (30 synthetic memories)
python3 create-demo-data.py

# 2. Start the dashboard on demo-visual profile
python3 ~/.claude-memory/ui_server.py
# (Dashboard runs on http://localhost:8765)

# 3. Capture screenshots
python3 capture-screenshots.py

# 4. Switch back to your main profile
python3 src/memory-profiles.py switch default
```

## Scripts

Two Python scripts are included in the repository root for regenerating this content:

### `create-demo-data.py`
- Creates a `demo-visual` profile
- Populates it with 30 synthetic software development memories
- Builds the knowledge graph (6 clusters)
- Safe to run multiple times (replaces existing demo data)

### `capture-screenshots.py`
- Uses Playwright to automate browser screenshots
- Captures all dashboard views in light mode
- Captures key views in dark mode
- Handles tab navigation and waiting for content to load
- Outputs to `assets/screenshots/dashboard/`

**Requirements:**
```bash
pip install playwright
python -m playwright install chromium
```

## Notes

- All data in these screenshots is synthetic and non-sensitive
- No real API keys, passwords, or proprietary information
- The `demo-visual` profile is separate from your working profile
- Switching profiles does not affect your main memory database
- Screenshots were captured at 2x DPI for retina display quality
