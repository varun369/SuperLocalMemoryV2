"""
DbConnectionManager — Thread-safe SQLite connection management with WAL mode.

Solves the "database is locked" bug when multiple agents (CLI + MCP from Claude +
MCP from Cursor + API) try to write or recall simultaneously.

Architecture:
    - WAL mode (Write-Ahead Logging): Concurrent reads OK during writes
    - Busy timeout (5s): Connections wait instead of failing immediately
    - Connection pool: Reusable read connections via thread-local storage
    - Write queue: Single dedicated writer thread serializes all writes
    - Singleton: One manager per database path per process

This is a PREREQUISITE for the Event Bus (v2.5). The write queue guarantees:
    1. Every write succeeds (queued, not dropped)
    2. Events fire after commit, not before (consistency)
    3. Events arrive in correct order (queue preserves order)
    4. Multiple agents can write simultaneously without conflict

Usage:
    from db_connection_manager import DbConnectionManager

    mgr = DbConnectionManager.get_instance(db_path)

    # Reads — concurrent, non-blocking
    conn = mgr.get_read_connection()
    try:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT ...")
        rows = cursor.fetchall()
    finally:
        mgr.release_read_connection(conn)

    # Writes — serialized through queue
    def do_insert(conn):
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO ...", (...))
        conn.commit()
        return cursor.lastrowid

    result = mgr.execute_write(do_insert)

    # Context manager for reads (preferred)
    with mgr.read_connection() as conn:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT ...")

    Key features:
