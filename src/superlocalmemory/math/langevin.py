"""Riemannian Langevin dynamics with persistence for memory lifecycle.

Evolves memory positions via a discretised Langevin SDE driven by an
access-aware potential function.  Frequently accessed memories are
confined near the origin (ACTIVE, high retrieval weight) by a strong
potential, while neglected memories diffuse toward the boundary
(ARCHIVED, weight approaches 0) as their confinement weakens.

Core SDE (Girolami & Calderhead 2011):

    xi_{t+1} = xi_t - g^{-1}(xi_t) * grad U(xi_t) * dt
             + sqrt(2 * T * dt) * g^{-1/2}(xi_t) * eta

Potential function:

    U(xi) = alpha * ||xi||^2
           - beta  * log(access_count + 1)
           + gamma * age_days
           - delta * importance

    - Accessed memories:  beta term lowers potential  -> drift to origin
    - Old / unused:       gamma term raises potential -> drift to boundary
    - Important memories: delta term lowers potential -> retain near origin

V1 bugs fixed in Innovation Wave 4:
    1. Positions were computed per-recall then DISCARDED.  Now ``step()``
       and ``batch_step()`` return new positions for the caller to persist.
    2. Weight range was [0.7, 1.0] --- too narrow to change rankings.
       Now [0.0, 1.0] so archived memories can be effectively suppressed.
