"""M006 — action_outcomes reward + settlement columns (memory.db).

Extends ``action_outcomes`` with the four columns the learning trainer
needs in order to swap off the position proxy onto the real reward
label:

  * ``reward REAL`` — numeric reward (usually in [-1, 1]).
  * ``settled INTEGER DEFAULT 0`` — 1 when the outcome has been settled.
  * ``settled_at TEXT`` — ISO-8601 timestamp of settlement.
  * ``recall_query_id TEXT`` — links the outcome back to the recall that
    produced the candidate facts (so the trainer can join against
    ``learning_signals.query_id``).

The gate in ``learning.database.fetch_training_examples``
(``_migration_applied("M006_action_outcomes_reward")``) already falls
back to the position proxy when this migration hasn't completed, so a
skipped/failed apply never crashes the trainer.

Deferred: this migration is NOT in ``MIGRATIONS``. It ships via
``DEFERRED_MIGRATIONS`` and runs from the daemon lifespan immediately
after ``MemoryEngine.initialize()`` has bootstrapped the
``action_outcomes`` table. Idempotent — ``verify(conn)`` returns True
once all four columns are present, so reapply is a no-op.
