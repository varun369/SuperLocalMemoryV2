"""Forward-only additive migrations for SLM v3.4.21.

LLD reference: ``.backup/active-brain/lld/LLD-07-schema-migrations-and-security-primitives.md``
Section 4 (Migration Runner).

Contract:
  - ``apply_all(learning_db, memory_db, *, dry_run=False) -> dict`` —
    runs every v3.4.21 migration, idempotent and transactional. Returns
    ``{"applied": [names], "skipped": [names], "failed": [names],
       "details": {name: str}}``.
  - ``status(learning_db, memory_db) -> dict[str, str]`` — returns the
    status of each migration as recorded in the target DB's ``migration_log``
    (``"complete"``, ``"failed"``, ``"in_progress"``, or ``"missing"``).

Hard rules enforced (LLD-07 §7):
  - MIG-HR-01: idempotent — re-applying is a no-op.
  - MIG-HR-02: atomic — each migration wrapped in BEGIN IMMEDIATE / COMMIT
    via the DDL itself (or by the single-statement guarantee).
  - MIG1: ``ddl_sha256`` prevents silent DDL drift.
  - MIG3: a failing migration does NOT prevent the runner from attempting
    the rest, and does NOT raise to the caller — result comes through the
    returned stats dict.
