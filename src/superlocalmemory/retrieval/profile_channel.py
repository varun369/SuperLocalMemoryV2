"""SuperLocalMemory V3 — Profile Channel (Entity-Profile Retrieval).

Returns fact IDs from entity profiles — enables direct answers for
"What does Alice do?" style queries without full embedding search.

This is a SHORTCUT channel: if the query mentions a known entity,
the profile's accumulated fact IDs are injected directly into the
retrieval pool with high scores.

Competitor reference: EverMemOS profile synthesis (~+15-20% SH).
